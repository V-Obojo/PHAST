## Appendix

- **PSS Factors**: I = Impact (0–10), L = Likelihood (0–10), E = Exposure (0–10), R = Response Readiness (0–10), C = Confidence (0–10).
- **How to use this document**: Each technique has baseline PSS factors to speed triage. Analysts must update the PSS per incident using local intel.
- **Cross-Context Links**: Techniques often overlap (e.g., SIM swap appears in FF and OS). Use the Cross-Context Link column to identify fusion opportunities.
- **Actors/Channels**: Local actors referenced include Yahoo Boys, bandit/insurgent groups (Boko Haram/ISWAP), telcos (MTN, Airtel), major banks, logistics firms, and social platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook).
